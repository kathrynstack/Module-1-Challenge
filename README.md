HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

The goal of refactoring the code in this challenge was to modify the starter code to be more accessible.

The motivation behind refactoring this code was to not only clean it up, but to make it accessible for everyone who visits the webpage.
I refactored this code so that it could become a more precise body of code so if anyone else needs to utlize it, they have an easier time reading it. The website is also now accessible if any of the images were to fail to load.
This solved the problem of if the website were to lose the images, a descriptive alt tag would be able to help the site visitor, as well as someone who may need accessibilty assistance. It also solved the problem of having a long list of CSS code.
I learned how to condense code in a fashion that is helpful for other developers to use.
